 <p class="tbd"> About - Hey, my name is Anne-Laure & this is my photographic portfolio.<br />

 I grew up around the world, mainly in hot places, on the African continent & Pacific Islands. Before becoming the mum of a little boy in 2015, I worked in the travel industry- which is lucky as I quite like travelling! I am also incredibly blessed to be married to the most amazing being I know. I am a bit of a handful!<br /> 

 To sum up: I am a traveller, wife, mum, "lost in transition" triathlete, outdoors fan, part-time hippie, craft-lover not-so-extraordinaire, born French, German-educated, London girl where I live with our dog Chilli Pepper and two cats Gin & Tonic.<br />

 This portfolio reflects what I love most in life. You can also follow my adventures through my blog.</p>
